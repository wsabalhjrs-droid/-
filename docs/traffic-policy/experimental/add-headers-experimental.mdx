The **Add Headers** Traffic Policy action enables you to add headers to an HTTP request before it is sent upstream or an HTTP response before it is sent back to the client.

This action will only _add_ headers to the request or response. If the header already exists it will append another header with the same key unless it is the `host` header, see [Special Cases](#special-cases).

:::tip
To replace or remove headers, use the [`remove-headers`](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/remove-headers) action then add the header with the desired value.

## Add headers to a request

When configured in the `on_http_request` phase, this action will add the specified headers to incoming http requests before reaching the upstream server. When

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add headers to the request from the upstream service when the method is `GET` and the URL starts with `/status/200`.

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	yamlMetastring="{6-10}"
	jsonMetastring="{8-16}"
	config={{
		on_http_response: [
			{
				expressions: [
					'req.method == "GET" && req.url.path.startsWith("/status/200")',
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "add-headers",
						config: {
							headers: {
								"x-custom-header": "my-custom-value",
								"x-string-interpolation-example": "started at ${conn.ts.start}",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

## Add headers to a response

To add headers to the response from the upstream service, you must configure the `add-headers` action to run during the `on_http_response` phase.

The following [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy/)
configuration will add headers to the response from the upstream service when the method is `GET` and the URL starts with `/status/200`.

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	yamlMetastring="{6-10}"
	jsonMetastring="{8-16}"
	config={{
		on_http_response: [
			{
				expressions: [
					'req.method == "GET" && req.url.path.startsWith("/status/200")',
				],
				actions: [
					{
						type: "add-headers",
						config: {
							headers: {
								"x-custom-header": "my-custom-value",
								"x-string-interpolation-example": "started at ${conn.ts.start}",
							},
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

For this example, we are assuming that ngrok is pointing at the upstream service
https://httpbin.org and we will be adding two headers:

- `x-custom-header` with the value `my-custom-value`
- `x-string-interpolation-example` with the value `started at ${conn.ts.start}`
  to demonstrate the use of CEL interpolation to include the request connection
  start time.

#### Example Request

```shell
$ curl -i https://httpbin.ngrok.app/status/200
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
x-custom-header: my-custom-value
x-string-interpolation-example: started at 2024-07-13T00:10:16Z
```

## Enrich your upstream services

Add new headers to requests to give your upstream service more context about the consumer, which in turn allows for richer functionality, such as localized languages and pricing.

This rule adds multiple headers to the request, including the client's IP address, the endpoint ID, and the client's location.

<ConfigExample
	config={{
		on_http_request: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "add-headers",
						config: {
							"x-is-ngrok": "1",
							"x-endpoint-id": "${endpoint.id}",
							"x-client-ip": "${conn.client_ip}",
							"x-client-conn-start": "${conn.ts.start}",
							"x-client-loc": "${conn.geo.city}, ${conn.geo.country}",
							"x-client-path": "${req.url.path}",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>
