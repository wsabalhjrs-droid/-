# Traffic Policy Overview

The ngrok Traffic Policy engine enables you to manage traffic consistently across your endpoints. It allows you to inspect, manipulate, and route traffic in a structured way.

Traffic Policy is composed of a few key components:

- **Phases:** Defined points in the traffic lifecycle where you can apply logic.
- **Phase Rules:** The set of conditions and actions applied during specific phases to filter, manipulate, or manage traffic.
- **Expressions:** Conditions used in Phase Rules to determine when an action should be applied.
- **Actions:** Logic that is triggered when a Phase Rule condition is met.
- **CEL Interpolation:** A way to dynamically evaluate variables and macros inside configuration values, such as URLs or headers.

By combining these components, Traffic Policy provides a powerful way to control your traffic flow at a fine-grained level.

## Phase Rules

Each Phase is made up of Phase Rules. Phase Rules allow you to define how traffic is filtered and processed within a phase. To do this each rule consists of two key parts: **expressions** and **actions**.

Here is an example:

```yaml
on_tcp_connect:
  - expressions:
      - conn.client_ip == '192.168.1.200'
    actions:
      - type: deny
```

### Chaining Rules and Priority

Multiple rules can be defined within a single phase. Rules are evaluated in the order they are defined, and their execution depends on the type of actions taken. For example:

- Some actions (e.g., `deny`) immediately stop further rule evaluation.
- Others (e.g., `url-rewrite`) allow subsequent rules to apply.

## Expressions

Expressions are conditions written in [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) that can be used to evaluate specific traffic attributes, such as the client IP, request URL, or HTTP method. These conditions determine whether a rule applies to a given traffic flow. For instance, an expression like `conn.client_ip == '192.168.1.200'` targets requests from a specific IP address.

You can define multiple expressions, which are automatically combined using the `&&` operator. This means all expressions in the list must evaluate to `true` for the associated rules to run. If no expressions are provided, the system defaults to `true`, ensuring the rule matches all traffic, and the specified actions are executed in sequence.

Expressions in traffic policies can reference a variety of elements, including:

- Traffic Policy Variables: These allow you to access metadata about the connection or request, such as certificate details, headers, client IP, geo-location and more.
- Traffic Policy Macros: Macros simplify complex conditions, enabling reusable patterns across expressions and policies.
- Traffic Policy Action Variables: Some actions may provide additional variables, enabling deeper customization based on specific action outcomes.

### Basic Syntax

Expressions are written in CEL and are similar to expressions in languages like C, JavaScript, or Python. They can include variables, literals, and operators.

### Variables

Variables refer to values. For example, `identity` might refer to a user object.

```yaml
expressions:
  - identity.age >= 18 // Checks if the user's age is 18 or more.
```

#### Match Based on Header

```yaml
expressions:
  - req.headers["authorization"][0] == "Bearer my-token"
```

#### Match Requests to a Specific Path

```yaml
expressions:
  - req.url.path.startsWith("/api/v1/")
```

#### Match by Country

```yaml
expressions:
  - conn.client_ip.geo.location.country_code == "US"
```

### Literals

CEL supports several literal types:

- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`
- **Integer**: `42`, `-7`
- **String**: `"hello"`, `'world'`
- **List**: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Map**: `{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}`

### Operators

CEL provides a rich set of operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations:

- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

#### Using Arithmetic

```go
5 * (3 - 1) // Evaluates to 10
```

#### Using Comparison and Logical Operators

```go
// Checks if the user is 18 or older and is in the US
identity.age >= 18 && identity.country == "US"
```

### Strings

#### String Concatenation

To combine strings, use the `+` operator:

```go
"Hello, " + "world!" // Results in "Hello, world!"
```

#### String Functions

CEL provides several built-in functions to work with strings, enabling you to perform transformations, query information, or compare strings.

##### `size()`

Returns the number of characters in the string:

```go
size("Hello") // Evaluates to 5
```

##### `startsWith()`

Checks if the string starts with a specified substring:

```go
"Hello, world".startsWith("Hello") // Evaluates to true
```

##### `endsWith()`

Checks if the string ends with a specified substring:

```go
"Hello, world".endsWith("world") // Evaluates to true
```

##### `matches()`

Determines if the string matches a regular expression pattern:

```go
"Hello, world".matches("H.*d") // Evaluates to true
```

##### `contains()`

To check if a string contains another string:

```go
"Hello, world!".contains("world") // Evaluates to true
```

#### Advanced String Manipulation

##### Regular Expressions

CEL's `matches()` function allows you to use regular expressions for pattern matching. This can be powerful for validation or extracting parts of strings:

```go
// Evaluates to true for a valid email format
"user@example.com".matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$")
```

##### Concatenation and Interpolation

While direct string interpolation isn't a feature in CEL, concatenation can be used to dynamically construct strings:

```go
// Interpolates number to string
"Your order number is: " + string(order_number)
```

##### Working with Unicode

Strings in CEL are Unicode and can handle a wide range of characters:

```go
// Evaluates to 5, as there are 5 characters in this Japanese greeting
size("こんにちは")
```

##### String Comparison

String comparison in CEL is case-sensitive and uses the standard comparison operators:

```go
"apple" == "Apple" // Evaluates to false due to case difference
"apple" < "banana" // Alphabetically compares strings, evaluates to true
```

### Lists

A list in CEL is an ordered collection of elements. You can perform various operations on lists, including checking if an item is contained within a list, accessing elements by their index, and iterating over elements.

#### Creating a List

```go
var my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### Checking for Membership

To check if a value exists in a list, use the `in` operator:

```go
2 in my_list; // Evaluates to true
5 in my_list; // Evaluates to false
```

#### Accessing Elements

Access elements by their index (0-based):

```go
// Accesses the second element, evaluates to 2
my_list[1];
```

#### Counting Elements

Returns the number of elements in the list:

```go
size(my_list) // Evaluates to 4
```

#### Iterating Over a List

Use a comprehension to iterate over elements in a list and apply logic:

```go
// Doubles each value in the list, resulting in [2, 4, 6, 8]
[value * 2 for value in my_list]
```

#### Filtering a List

Filter a list to include only certain elements:

```go
// Keeps only values greater than 2, resulting in [3, 4]
[value for value in my_list if value > 2]
```

#### Membership in Lists

The `in` operator is versatile and can be used to check for membership in both lists:

```go
// For maps (checks keys)
"apple" in { apple: 1, banana: 2 } // true
```

### Maps

A map in CEL is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and each key maps to exactly one value. You can check for the presence of keys, access values by their keys, and iterate over keys or values.

#### Creating a Map

```go
var my_map = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

#### Checking for Key Presence

To check if a key is present in a map, use the `in` operator:

```go
"a" in my_map; // Evaluates to true
"d" in my_map; // Evaluates to false
```

#### Accessing Values

Access values by their keys:

```go
// Accesses the value for the key "a", evaluates to 1
my_map["a"]
```

#### Counting Elements

Returns the number of key-value pairs present in the map:

```go
size(my_map) // Evaluates to 3
```

#### Iterating Over a Map

You can iterate over the keys or values of a map using a comprehension:

```go
// Extracts all keys, resulting in ["a", "b", "c"]
[key for key, value in my_map]

// Extracts all values, resulting in [1, 2, 3]
[value for key, value in my_map]
```

#### Checking for a Condition in a Map

Use `exists` or `all` macros to check if any or all elements in a collection meet a condition:

```go
// Checks if any key in the map starts with "a"
my_map.exists(key, key.startsWith("a")) // Evaluates to true

// Checks if all values in the map are greater than 0
my_map.all(value, value > 0) // Evaluates to true
```

#### Membership in Maps

The `in` operator is versatile and can be used to check for membership in maps:

```go
// For maps (checks keys)
"apple" in { apple: 1, banana: 2 } // true
```

## Actions

Actions define the behavior that is applied when the expressions evaluate to true. Each action specifies a particular operation to be applied, such as denying traffic, modifying headers, or redirecting requests. Actions are executed sequentially as defined in the policy, but note that some actions can short-circuit the request and return without executing subsequent actions.

## Phases

In Traffic Policy, a phase represents a distinct point in the lifecycle of a request as it moves through an ngrok endpoint. Phases allow you to inspect, process, and manage traffic at key moments.

### `on_tcp_connect`

The first phase in the traffic lifecycle. This phase is triggered when a new TCP connection is established. It provides an opportunity to allow, reject, or manipulate connections before any higher-level protocol processing begins. This phase is present in all traffic to the endpoint.

### `on_http_request`

Activated when ngrok receives an HTTP request over an established connection. This phase provides access to the request's details (e.g., headers, method, path) as variables and is ideal for actions like forwarding traffic, rewriting paths, or applying authentication and rate limits.

### `on_http_response`

Triggered after ngrok receives a response from the upstream service. This phase allows you to modify the response before it is sent to the client, such as by adding headers, changing status codes, or transforming the response body.

# CEL Interpolation

**CEL Interpolation** allows you to write dynamic configurations for traffic policy actions. It enables expressions to be embedded within string fields of a configuration object, making the traffic policy system more flexible and powerful.

When an action in a traffic policy requires a configuration object, some fields allow CEL expressions to be interpolated directly into strings. This means that you can define dynamic values that are computed based on traffic, connection, or previously executed action variables.

For example, when using the `add-headers` action, the `headers` field is a key-value map, where the header values can contain CEL expressions. This allows you to use real-time traffic data, such as the client's IP address, to populate header values dynamically.

## How CEL Interpolation Works

In the context of traffic policy actions, CEL expressions can be written within strings using a special syntax: `${expression}`. This tells the system to evaluate the expression at runtime and replace the placeholder with the resulting value.

For example, consider the following configuration for the `add-headers` action:

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - name: CEL Interpolation Example
    actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            X-Client-IP: "${conn.client_ip}"
            X-Request-Path: "${req.url.path}"
```

In this example:

- The header `X-Client-IP` is set to the value of the client's IP address (`conn.client_ip`).
- The header `X-Request-Path` dynamically reflects the path of the incoming request (`req.url.path`).

When the rule is executed, the system evaluates the CEL expressions and substitutes the results into the configuration.

## What Can Be Interpolated?

You can use the following inside of CEL interpolated expressions:

- traffic policy Variables (including traffic policy action variables)
- traffic policy Macros

This dynamic configuration enables traffic policies to be tailored based on specific conditions at runtime.

## Example Use Cases

### Custom Header Values

Set headers dynamically based on incoming traffic, such as client IP, request path, or even specific action results.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - name: CEL Interpolation Example
    actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
            X-Country-Code: "${conn.geo.country_code}"
            X-User-Agent: "${req.headers['User-Agent'][0]}"
```

### Debugging

Take the result of an action and set it as metadata on the event stream log for the request or output the response as a custom response to see the result immediately, kind of like `console.log`.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "restrict-ips"
        config:
          enforce: false
          ip_policies:
            - "ipp_2p2q5Yt85IKQQ7zbpR4XmUpyVIN"
      - type: "log"
        config:
          metadata:
            message: "Restrict IPs action would be ${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.action} for ${conn.client_ip}."
            matched_cidr: "${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.matched_cidr}"
            error_code: "${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.error.code}"
            error_message: "${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.error.message}"
      - type: "custom-response"
        config:
          status_code: 403
          body: "Restrict IPs action would be ${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.action} for ${conn.client_ip}. The matched CIDR is ${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.matched_cidr}. Your error code is ${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.error.code} and the error message is the following: ${actions.ngrok.restrict_ips.error.message}"
          headers:
            content-type: "text/html"
```
