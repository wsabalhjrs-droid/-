## What is a Traffic Policy?

The ngrok Traffic Policy engine enables you to manage traffic consistently across your endpoints.
It allows you to inspect, manipulate, and route traffic in a structured way.

## Features

Traffic Policy is composed of a few key components:

- [**Phases:**](./phases) Defined points in the traffic lifecycle where you can apply logic.
- [**Phase Rules:**](./phase-rules) The set of conditions and actions applied during specific phases to filter, manipulate, or manage traffic.
- [**Expressions:**](./expressions) Conditions used in Phase Rules to determine when an action should be applied.
- [**Actions:**](./actions) Logic that is triggered when a Phase Rule condition is met.
- [**CEL Interpolation:**](./cel-interpolation) A way to dynamically evaluate variables and macros inside configuration values, such as URLs or headers.
