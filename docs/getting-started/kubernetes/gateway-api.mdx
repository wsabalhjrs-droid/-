This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s) and [Gateway API
resources](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to make the services you've
deployed to Kubernetes available on the public internet.

Benefits:

- TK

Example use cases:

- TK
- TK

## What you'll need

- An ngrok account and a [reserved domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
- A running K8s cluster with `kubectl` access with at least one service
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) and
  [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0.0 or later installed locally

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator

<K8sSetup />
<K8sGWAPI />
<K8sInstall />

## 2. Define your `Gateway` and `HTTPSRoute` resources

TK

The ngrok Kubernetes operator watches for these and provisions ngrok endpoints

## 3. Secure your app with Traffic Policy
