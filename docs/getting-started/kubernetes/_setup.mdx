### Add the ngrok Helm chart

```bash
helm repo add ngrok https://charts.ngrok.com
helm repo update
```

:::note
Whenever you want to update the operator or install a new version, you must run `helm repo update` to fetch the latest charts.

### Get your ngrok API Key and authtoken

In order to use the ngrok Kubernetes Operator, you will need an ngrok account.
Once you have an account, you will need to log into the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) to gather the necessary credentials.

You will need two things from the dashboard:

- Your auth token, which can be found [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
- An API key, which can be generated [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api)

These credentials will be created as a Kubernetes secret, which the controller will have access to.
The auth token is used to create tunnels, and the API key is used to manage resources via the ngrok API.

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your copied auth token goes here
export NGROK_API_KEY=your copied api key goes here
```

### Select your Namespace

Set the following variable to whatever you would like the installation namespace to be.
We recommend using the default `ngrok-operator` namespace unless you need to change that.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=ngrok-operator
```
