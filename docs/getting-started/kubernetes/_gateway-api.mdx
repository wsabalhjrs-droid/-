### Install the Gateway API custom resource definitions

The Gateway API CRDs can be installed at a later point, but you will need to
restart the operator after installing the Gateway API CRDs for the Gateway API
support to be enabled.

You can select either the standard or experimental set of Gateway API CRDs
depending on your preference. Either version will work with the ngrok Kubernetes
operator.

After installing the Gateway API CRDs, create the following `GatewayClass` so
that you can mark which Gateway API resources that the ngrok operator should
handle

```bash
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
	name: ngrok
spec:
	controllerName: ngrok.com/gateway-controller
EOF
```
