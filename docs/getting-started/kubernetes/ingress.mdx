This quickstart uses the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s) and a
[Kubernetes Ingress
object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to
make the services you've deployed to Kubernetes available on the public
internet.

## What you'll need

- An ngrok account and a [reserved domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
- A running K8s cluster with `kubectl` access with at least one service
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) and
  [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0.0 or later installed locally

## 1. Install the ngrok Kubernetes Operator
