description: Learn how ngrok assignes TCP Addresses.

You can create TCP Addresses in [the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tcp-addresses) or via [the API](/api/resources/reserved-addrs/). The following limitations apply:

- When you create a TCP Address, the hostname and port are randomly assigned. Both are permanent.
  - You may not choose the hostname or port.
- If you delete a TCP Address, there is no way to provision the same one again.
- TCP Addresses may be managed via the dashboard or API.
- The port of your TCP Address is uniquely assigned to your account, but other ports on that same hostname may be assigned to other accounts.
- While the hostname and port of a TCP Address is fixed, they do not have static IPs.
