---

You may create a Domain with a wildcard name, e.g. `*.example.com`. A wildcard domain enables you to:

- Create an endpoint which receives traffic for all of its subdomains, e.g. `https://*.example.com`. See [Wildcard Endpoints](/universal-gateway/http/#wildcard-endpoints) to understand the rules for matching and precedence.
- Create an endpoint on any subdomain which matches the wildcard, e.g. `https://foo.example.com` or `https://foo.bar.baz.example.com`

:::note
The wildcard `*` character may only be used as the first part of a
domain, you may not create domains like `app.*.example.com` or
`*-app.example.com`.
:::

## TLS provisioning

When you bring your own wildcard domain (e.g. `*.app.example.com`), ngrok uses
a DNS01 challenge for TLS certificate provisioning which means that you must
create two CNAME records when creating branded wildcard domains instead of just
one.

For example, If your domain is `*.app.example.com` you will be required to create the
following two CNAME records:

- `*.app.example.com`
- `_acme-challenge.app.example.com`

Certificate provisioning will not begin until you have created both DNS
records.

## Pricing

Wildcard domains are available on our Enterprise plan self service. They are also available on Pay-as-You-Go plans if you contact support@ngrok.com. For Pay-as-You-Go when you create a wildcard domain and run endpoints domain `*.foo.com`, endpoints `https://a.foo.com` and `https://b.foo.com`, we bill you for each individual endpoint, which is why we ask that you request the feature.

Reserving subdomains of a wildcard domain within the ngrok dashboard count towards the number of reserved domains in your account. For example, if you reserve `foo.example.com` and `*.example.com`, you have reserved two domains.. You will be charged for each subdomain you use. You may need to enable overages in order to do this on your paid plan.
