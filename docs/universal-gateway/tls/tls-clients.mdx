title: Supported TLS Clients
description: Learn about the different TLS clients available for ngrok and how to use them.
---

ngrok's TLS endpoints are designed to work with TLS clients that fit the criteria described on this page.

## SNI

TLS endpoints only work with modern TLS clients that populate the SNI
extension. See the documentation on [TLS
Termination](/universal-gateway/tls/tls-termination/#sni) for additional
details on compatible clients.

## STARTTLS

Protocols that begin in plain text and upgrade to TLS via a mechanism like
STARTTLS in SMTP, IMAP, etc are not supported. If you need to support
connections which upgrade to TLS, use a [TCP
Endpoint](/universal-gateway/tcp/).
