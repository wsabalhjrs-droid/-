title: What are Internal Endpoints?
description: Learn about staging internal services and applications using internal endpoints.
---

**Internal Endpoints** are private endpoints that only receive traffic when forwarded through the [`forward-internal` traffic policy action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/). This allows you to route traffic to an application through ngrok without making it publicly addressable.

Internal endpoint URLs must:

- End with the `.internal` domain extension
- Use the `internal` [binding](/docs/universal-gateway/bindings/)

:::tip
A common practice is to use a [public](/docs/universal-gateway/public-endpoints) [cloud endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/) to manage a centralized Traffic Policy, then forward traffic to one or more internal [endpoints](/docs/universal-gateway/endpoints/). See [the guide on using cloud endpoints with internal endpoints](/docs/guides/other-guides/forwarding-and-load-balancing-with-cloud-endpoints/) to learn more.

## Get started

See [the quickstart](/docs/universal-gateway/internal-endpoints/create-internal-endpoints) to create your first Internal Endpoint.

## Type and Pooling

Internal endpoints support:

- Both [Endpoint Types](/universal-gateway/types): `agent` and `cloud`.
- [Endpoint Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling).

## HTTP/S `on_tcp_connect` phase

For internal `http` and `https` endpoints, the `on_tcp_connect` [Traffic Policy](/traffic-policy/) phase is not applicable and never triggers.

This is because when you use the [`forward-internal` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/) to forward traffic to an `http` or `https` endpoint, no new TCP connection is established. For additional details, see the [`forward-internal` documentation](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/).

## API

Internal endpoints can be managed programatically. To get started, consult the [Endpoints API documentation](/api/resources/endpoints/).

## Pricing

Internal endpoints are available on the Pay-as-you-go plan. Consult the [Endpoints Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing) documentation for billing details.
