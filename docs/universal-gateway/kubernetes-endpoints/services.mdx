description: Learn how ngrok creates Kubernetes Services for kubernetes-bound endpoints.
---

After a kubernetes-bound endpoint is created, the ngrok cloud service notifies
Kubernetes Operators that a new kubernetes-bound endpoint exists. Kubernetes
Operators create `v1.Service` objects in their Kubernetes clusters which
forward traffic they receive to the operators' pods.

### `ClusterIP` Service

A Cluster IP service is created in the operator's namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <endpoint-id> # the endpoint's ID
  namespace: ngrok-operator
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ngrok-operator-forwarder
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # the endpoint url's port
      targetPort: <randomly-assigned> # assigned by operator to target the ngrok-operator-forwarder container
```

### `ExternalName` Service

An ExternalName service is created in the namespace targeted by the second part
of the URL's hostname.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: customer-2 # first part of the URL's hostname
  namespace: prod ## second part of the URL's hostname
spec:
  # Point service at the Operator Forwarder
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: <endpoint-id>.ngrok-operator.svc.cluster.local
```
