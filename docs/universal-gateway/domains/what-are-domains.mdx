title: How Do Domains Work With ngrok?
description: Learn how to create domains in your ngrok account.
---

Domains enable you to create [public endpoints](/universal-gateway/domains/public-endpoints/) with hostnames matching the domain. For example, after you create the domain `your-name.ngrok.app`, you may create the Endpoint `https://your-name.ngrok.app`.

Valid Domain names include:

- [ngrok-managed domains](/docs/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-managed-domains), like `foo.ngrok.app`.
- Your own [custom domains](/docs/universal-gateway/domains/bring-your-own-domain/), like `example.your-domain.com`, by creating a `CNAME` DNS record with your domain's DNS provider.

## Configuration

Domains also enable you to configure other domain-level behaviors, including:

- [**Global Load Balancer configuration**](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/#domains) - Choose which points of presence handle traffic to a Domain's matching endpoints.

  :::
- [**TLS Certificate management**](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-does-ngrok-handle-tls/) - Configure automatic certificate provisioning or select a certificate you uploaded yourself.
- [**Dedicated IP address configuration**](/universal-gateway/ip-addresses#dedicated-ips) - Attach static, dedicated IPs for a Domain's matching endpoints receive traffic on.

You can manage Domains on your [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or via the [ngrok API](#api).

## Ownership

Your account exclusively owns its Domains and all of their nested subdomains
within ngrok. That means:

- No account may create a Domain with a name that is a subdomain of your Domains.
- No other account may create endpoints with a hostname matching your Domain or any of its nested subdomains.

For example, if you create a Domain with the name `foo.ngrok.app`:

- No other account create the Domains `foo.ngrok.app` or `bar.foo.ngrok.app`.
- No other account may create the endpoints `https://foo.ngrok.app` or `https://bar.foo.ngrok.app`.

## API

Domains are programatically managed via:

- [`/reserved_domains` API Resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains/)

## Pricing

Domains are available on all plans. Some Domain features require upgrades. See the [Pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for details.
