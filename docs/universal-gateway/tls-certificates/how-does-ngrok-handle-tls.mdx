title: How Does ngrok Handle TLS Certificates?
description: Learn how ngrok handles TLS certificates.

ngrok [automatically handles](/universal-gateway/tls-certificatesautomatic-certificate-management) TLS (SSL) certificate management and termination for you out of the box, but you can also [customize how termination works](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/) and [use your own certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/custom-certificates).

You can manage TLS certificates with:

- [The Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tls-certs)
- [The API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).
- [The `terminate-tls` Traffic Policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/)

You can also [specify the local path to a certificate file](/agent/cli/#example-10) when starting a TLS endpoint with the Agent CLI.

## How certificates work

TLS certificates are composed of a private key and a certificate. These are presented by the ngrok cloud service during [TLS handshakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake) to terminate TLS connections to [HTTPS endpoints](/universal-gateway/http-s/) and [TLS endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls).

## Certificates with domains

TLS certificates are attached to [domains](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) for [termination of TLS connections to endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls/tls-termination/) whose URLs match that domain.

## Wildcard domains

See the [wildcard domains](/universal-gateway/wildcard-domains/#tls-provisioning) docs for more information about how TLS certificates are managed for wildcard domains.

## Mutual TLS

Mutual TLS is supported when terminating TLS at ngrok's cloud service via the `mutual_tls_certificate_authorities` field of the [`terminate-tls`](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls) traffic policy action.

You can also enable mutual TLS when terminating TLS at the agent via the `mutual_tls_certificate_authorities` property of the [`agent_tls_termination`](/agent/config/v3/#endpoint-configuration-options) section of an endpoint configuration in the [agent configuration](/agent/config/v3/) file.

## API

TLS certificates are managed programatically via:

- [`/tls_certificates` API Resource](/api/resources/tls-certificates/)

## Pricing

TLS certificates are available on all plans. Bringing your own certificates is available on the Enterprise plan. See the [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for details.
