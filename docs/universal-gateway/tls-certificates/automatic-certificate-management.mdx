title: What Is Automatic Certificate Management?
description: Learn how ngrok provisions TLS certificates.
---

Whenever you create a [domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/), ngrok automatically provisions and manages your TLS certificates by default. Your TLS certificates will be automatically provisioned **and renewed** with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/about/), an ACME-compliant certificate authority. Others may be supported in the future.

Alternatively, you can [bring your own TLS certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/custom-certificates) and [use your own certificate authority](/api/resources/certificate-authorities/).

:::tip
It is recommended that you choose automatic TLS certificate management unless you have special requirements.

## Let's Encrypt provisioning

ngrok is a [Let's Encrypt sponsor](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/).

When provisioning TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt, ngrok uses a [HTTP01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge) for most domains. When you create a [wildcard domain](#using-wildcard-domains), ngrok uses a [DNS01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) instead.

### How long does provisioning take?

TLS certificates are provisioned asynchronously. Depending on the speed of the ACME certificate authority, it can take anywhere between a few seconds to 10 minutes for your certificate to be provisioned.

You can check the status of a certificate provisioning job by [requesting the domain with ngrok's API](/api/resources/reserved-domains/#get-reserved-domain). Each domain object contains a `certificate_management_status` property.

## Configuring automatic management

You can use the API to configure automatic TLS certificate management for a domain by sending a request with the `"certificate_management_policy"` property to [`/reserved_domains/{id}`](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/#update-reserved-domain).

```bash
curl \
-X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
-d '{"certificate_management_policy":{"authority":"letsencrypt"},"description":"point-of-sale new york #302","http_endpoint_configuration_id":"ec_2uBNwE5PEQsAgI7WQkwC8mL1a2x","https_endpoint_configuration_id":"ec_2uBNwBytfQIshIWu9bdcD0Buy78","metadata":"{env: \"staging\", \"connector_id\":\"64698fcc-5f5c-4b63-910e-8669d04bd943\"}"}' \
https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_domains/rd_2uBNwCkQlImhoyji1BWWiMGAHwc
```

### Private Keys

When using automatic TLS certificates, ngrok generates a private key for your
domain and encrypts it [at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest) with [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

When you configure a domain to use automated certificates, you can choose which type of private key will be generated for it. Options include:

- [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) (default)
- [RSA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>)
  - If you choose an RSA private key, it will be created with a size of `4096` bits.
