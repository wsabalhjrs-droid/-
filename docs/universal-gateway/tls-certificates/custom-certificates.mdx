title: Using Your Own Certificates
description: Learn how to use your own TLS certificates rather than automatic certificate management.
---

ngrok [manages TLS certificates for your domains automatically](/universal-gateway/tls-certificatesautomatic-certificate-management) by default, and in general automatic management is recommended. However, you may also upload and manage the renewal and rotation of your TLS certificates yourself.

:::warning
You cannot use your own certificates with [ngrok's managed domains](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-managed-domains).
:::

Uploading your own certificates may be the right choice if you are:

- Issuing certificates from your own preferred certificate authority
- Using an [EV certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate)

## Using your own certificate

To use your own TLS certificates with ngrok, you first need to upload the certificate, then attach it to a domain. To do so:

1. Upload a [certificate bundle](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/what-is-a-certificate-bundle/) and a [private key](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/what-are-private-tls-keys). You can do this with one of the following:
   - [The TLS section of the Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tls-certs)
   - [The API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/#create-tls-certificate):
     ```bash
     curl \
     -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     -d '{"certificate_pem":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\ncertificate-here\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----","private_key_pem":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nprivate-key-here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"}' \
     https://api.ngrok.com/tls_certificates
     ```
1. After you create your TLS certificate, you must attach it to one or more domains on ngrok before it can be used for termination. You can do so with one of the following:
   - [The Domains section of the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
     1. Select your domain.
     1. Expand the dropdown that says "Automated TLS Certificates" to choose the "Use an uploaded certificate" option.
   - [With the Domains API resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains/#update-reserved-domain), using the `certificate_id` property in the request body. You must have already uploaded your TLS certificate with the API or dashboard.
     ```bash
     curl \
     -X PATCH \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     -d '{"certificate_id":"id-for-certificate-here' \
     https://api.ngrok.com/reserved_domains/rd_2uBNwCkQlImhoyji1BWWiMGAHwc
     ```
