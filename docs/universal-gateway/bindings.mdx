description: Learn about the different types of ngrok endpoint bindings and how they work.

Every [ngrok Endpoint](/universal-gateway/endpoints) has a **binding**, which dictates how traffic can access it.

## Public Endpoints

Endpoints with a `public` binding have a publicly addressable [URL](/universal-gateway/what-are-endpoint-urls) that receives traffic from the internet via the ngrok cloud service's global points of presence. e.g. These endpoints might use an ngrok subdomain or a custom domain.

Example URLs:

- `https://example.ngrok.app`
- `https://blog.example.com`.

## Internal Endpoints

Endpoints with an `internal` binding can only receive traffic forwarded to them from other Endpoints in your ngrok account via the [`forward-internal` Traffic Policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal/).

Internal endpoints have URLs that end in `.internal`.

Example URLs:

- `https://example.internal`
- `tcp://ssh.internal:22`

## Kubernetes Endpoints

Endpoints with a `kubernetes` binding are private endpoints that are only available inside of Kubernetes clusters where you installed the [ngrok Kubernetes Operator](/k8s).

Example URLs:

- `http://service.namespace`
- `tcp://db.controlplane:5432`

:::note
TLS endpoints don't support the `kubernetes` binding.
