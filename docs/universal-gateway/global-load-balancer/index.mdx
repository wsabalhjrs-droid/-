title: What is the Global Load Balancer?
description: Learn about how ngrok's Global Load Balancer and how it improves the performance and resiliency of your applications.
---

ngrok's Global Load Balancer improves the performance and resiliency of your
applications by distributing traffic to the point of presence with the least latency from the client, and away from failing points of presence and upstream services.

Every application you deliver with ngrok is automatically accelerated with our always-on, zero-configuration global load balancer.

:::tip Remember
Global lobal balancing (or GSLB), balances traffic *to* endpoints. This is distinct from [endpoint pool load balancing](/universal-gateway/pooling/pool-load-balancing/), which balances traffic *between* your endpoints.

## vs. Traditional GSLBs

ngrok operates differently from a traditional GSLB to give you some important
benefits.

### Automatic geo-aware failover

Traditional GSLBs require you to:

- Run geographically redundant copies of your application
- Configure networking technologies to distribute and failover traffic among these deployments

By contrast, ngrok runs a [global delivery network of PoPs](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) for you. This means that even if you only deploy your upstream service to a single geography, your apps still get faster from [Connection Acceleration](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/gslb-endpoints/#connection-acceleration) and [Module Acceleration](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/gslb-endpoints/#module-acceleration).

### Zero configuration

Traditional GSLB deployments require network configuration updates, such as IP provisioning and DNS record changes, to bring new applications and services online.

With ngrok, when you deploy your applications and services to a new geographic location, nearby traffic is automatically routed to those services.

### Secure connections

Unlike a traditional reverse proxy, ngrok forwards traffic to your upstream services over secure connections established by the [ngrok agent](/agent/), [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks) or [Kubernetes Controller](/k8s/). So which PoPs do those agents connect to? ngrok also applies GSLB principles to those connections, ensuring that your agents connect to the geographically closest PoPs.
