description: ngrok adds headers to each HTTP request with information about the upstream client.

ngrok adds headers to each [HTTP request](/universal-gateway/http-s/) with information about the original
client IP, request scheme and request `host` header value.

| Header              | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-forwarded-for`   | The IP address of the client who initiated the request. If this header exists on the original request, ngrok will append a new value.       |
| `x-forwarded-proto` | The scheme of the original request, either `http` or `https`. If this header exists on the original request, ngrok will append a new value. |
| `x-forwarded-host`  | The header from the client's request if it existed, otherwise is set to the request's `Host` header value.                                  |

Because ngrok appends values to `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto`, be
sure to use the last value of the header in your application code to read the
values injected by ngrok.

You may remove these headers with the [Remove Headers](/traffic-policy/actions/remove-headers/) Traffic Policy action.
