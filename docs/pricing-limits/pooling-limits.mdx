Learn about the technical limits associated with ngrok's endpoint pools.

## Endpoint pool lifecycle

An Endpoint Pool is automatically created whenever you create two endpoints with:

- The same URL
- The same binding
- Pooling enabled

When only a single endpoint remains in a pool, the pool is deleted.

## Max pool size

There is no limit on the number of endpoints that may be in a pool.

## Supported protocols, bindings, and types

Endpoint pooling supports all:

- Protocols
- Bindings
- Types (and you can mix types in an endpoint pool)

## Conflicting endpoints

Endpoint pooling happens when two or more endpoints share a URL and binding, but both **only if these endpoints have [pooling enabled](/universal-gatway/pooling/#enabling-pooling)**. If an existing endpoint does not have pooling enabled, ngrok will return a conflict error when you try to create a new endpoint with the same URL and binding.

:::note
Conflicts can only occur during endpoint creation because both the URL and the `pooling_enabled` property may not be updated after an endpoint has been created.

### Endpoint pool protocols

The URLs of all endpoints in a pool must share the same protocol. For example, you may not pool the endpoints `https://foo.internal:1234` and
`tcp://foo.internal:1234` together because they have a different protocol.
