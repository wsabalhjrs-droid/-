ngrok's API gateway is designed for composability, allowing you to pick and
choose from many [Traffic Policy
actions](/docs/traffic-policy/actions) and order them in many ways to
manage API traffic according to your needs.

With our common pattern of using a cloud endpoint to route traffic to internal
agent endpoints, you can centrally manage certain policies like rate limiting or
authentication, then compose additional policies onto specific internal agent
endpoints and API services.

If you haven't yet deployed ngrok as your API gateway, start with one of these
tutorials:

- [Get started with an API gateway](/docs/guides/api-gateway/get-started)
- [Deploy an API gateway in Kubernetes](/docs/guides/api-gateway/kubernetes)
- [Deploy a multicloud API gateway](/docs/guides/api-gateway/multicloud)

## Add a rate limiting policy to all API services

We recommend you add a rate limiting policy on your cloud endpoint to protect
all your services from unintentional misuse and malicious attacks.

When you apply rate limiting to your cloud endpoint, then forward traffic to one
or more internal URLs, then ngrok applies the policy equally across all your API
services.

The Traffic Policy file below:

1. Allows up to `10` requests per IP in a `60s` window.
2. Rejects requests that exceed the rate limiting `capacity` with a `429` error response.
3. Forwards all requests not subject to the rate limit to an internal endpoint.
   You will need to edit this action, and potentially add additional
   `forward-internal` actions, based on your routing topology.

```yaml title="policy.yaml" mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: rate-limit
				config:
					name: Only allow 10 requests per minute
					algorithm: sliding_window
					capacity: 10
					rate: 60s
					bucket_key:
						- conn.client_ip
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://foo.internal
```

Apply the rule to your cloud endpoint with the dashboard or API.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="Dashboard">

    		Navigate to the [Endpoints](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints) section
    		of the ngrok dashboard and click on the cloud endpoint to edit.

    		Paste in the YAML above and click **Save** to apply the Traffic Policy rules.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="API">

    		Save the YAML above into a file named `policy.yaml` or similar.

    		Use the ngrok CLI to update your endpoint based on its `id`.

    		```
    		ngrok api endpoints update \
    		{ENDPOINT_ID} \
    		--traffic-policy "$(cat policy.yaml)"
    		```

    		:::tip
    		If you don't remember your cloud endpoint's `id`, run `ngrok api endpoints list` and find it from the list.
    		:::

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Test your rate limiting policy

You can test the rate limiting action by running the following command,
substituting the appropriate value for `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`:

```bash
for i in `seq 1 50`; do curl -X GET -w '%{http_code}' https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/ ; done
```

You'll see a few normal responses until you hit the rate limit, and then you'll
see `429` errors returned.

## Add a security policy to all API services

The JWT validation policy action allows you to integrate your ngrok endpoints
with your existing authentication provider. This example provides step-by-step
instructions for integrating with Auth0, but you can configure JWT validation
for any OAuth provider.

### Define your API in Auth0

1. Log in to your [Auth0 tenant dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).
1. Select **Applications > APIs**, then **+ Create API**.
1. Name your API whatever you'd like.
1. Replace the value of the **Identifier** field with `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`.
1. Leave the default values for **JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile \*** and **JSON
   Web Token Signing Algorithm \***.
1. Click **Create**.

<img
	src={Auth0}
	alt="Auth0 Create API"
	className="center w-full rounded-md border shadow-lg md:w-3/4"
/>

### Access your JWT

Upon creating your new API, Auth0 will create an associated application under
**Applications > APIs** in the left navigation bar.

Navigate to your application, and click on the `Test` tab. Here, you will
find a signed, fully functional JWT, as well as examples of how to programmatically
generate one.

### Update your Traffic Policy rules with the `validate-jwt` action

The Traffic Policy file below:

1. Integrates ngrok with your authentication provider so ngrok can validate JWTs
   passed in requests to your API.
2. Rejects requests without a `Authorization: Bearer ...` header or valid token.
3. Forwards all authenticated requests to an internal endpoint. You will need to
   edit this action, and potentially add additional `forward-internal` actions,
   based on your routing topology.

```yaml title="policy.yaml" traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: "jwt-validation"
        config:
          issuer:
            allow_list:
              - value: "https://{YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT_ID}.us.auth0.com/"
          audience:
            allow_list:
              - value: "https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}"
          http:
            tokens:
              - type: "jwt"
                method: "header"
                name: "Authorization"
                prefix: "Bearer "
          jws:
            allowed_algorithms:
              - "RS256"
            keys:
              sources:
                additional_jkus:
                  - "https://{YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT_ID}.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
  - actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: "https://foo.internal"
```

Replace `{YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT_ID}` and `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` and apply the rule to
your cloud endpoint with the dashboard or API.

You can test the JWT validation policy, substituting your domain for
`{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` and the JWT obtained from the Auth0 dashboard for
`{YOUR_JWT}`:

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/ \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_JWT}"
```

By authenticating yourself against ngrok's JWT validation, you'll get the
expected response. If you include an invalid token, you'll see a `403 Forbidden`
error, and if you send a request with no `Authorization` header, you'll get `401
Unauthorized` error.

## Compose policies on specific API services

In certain cases, you'll want to apply Traffic Policy rules to just one API
service—in those cases, you should update your internal agent endpoint with a
Traffic Policy file.

### Example with URL rewrites

The [`url-rewrite` Traffic Policy
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/url-rewrite/) lets you to modify the
incoming request URL before it reaches your API service and invisibly to the
user—perfect for routing user requests without exposing details about your
internal systems.

To rewrite one path to another:

```yaml title="url-rewrite.yaml" mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path == '/foo'"
    actions:
      - type: url-rewrite
        config:
          from: /foo
          to: /bar
```

To rewrite multiple URLs using regular expressions:

```
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - req.url.path.startsWith('/products')
    actions:
      - type: url-rewrite
        config:
          from: /foo/?([.*]+)?
          to: /bar/$1
```

Restart the ngrok agent on the same internal URL, while also specifying your new
Traffic Policy file.

```
ngrok http 8080 --url https://foo.internal --traffic-policy-file=url-rewrite.yaml
```

:::tip
If you're using other configuration flags, like `--pooling-enabled`, make
sure you add those to the command above.
:::

When you send a request to the `/foo` path, your API service will respond as
though it had come from the `/bar` path.

### Example with the `circuit-breaker` action

For example, one API service is running on a machine with less system resources,
making it more suseptible to errors during peak load. You can implement the
[`circuit-breaker` Traffic Policy
action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/circuit-breaker) on just the internal
agent endpoint that forwards traffic to that service for additional protection.

Create a new Traffic Policy file named `circuit-breaker.yaml` on the system
where this internal agent endpoint runs. To help you see how it works, the
following `circuit-breaker` rule sets an intentionally low volume threshold that
allows `10` requests in a `60s` window before tripping the circuit breaker for
`2m`.

```yaml title="circuit-breaker.yaml" mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: circuit-breaker
        config:
          error_threshold: 0
          volume_threshold: 10
          window_duration: 60s
          tripped_duration: 2m
          enforce: true
```

Restart the ngrok agent on the same internal URL, while also specifying your new
Traffic Policy file.

```
ngrok http 8080 --url https://foo.internal --traffic-policy-file=circuit-breaker.yaml
```

:::tip
If you're using other configuration flags, like `--pooling-enabled`, make
sure you add those to the command above.
:::

You can test this behavior out by sending multiple `curl` requests to your APIs
in quick succession to trip the circuit breaker.
