## Overview

The **Terminate TLS** Traffic Policy action allows you to control how TLS traffic is terminated by ngrok. This action is useful for when you need to specify a custom certificate, control which TLS versions are supported, or enable mutual TLS authentication.

:::note
This Traffic Policy action is great for restricting traffic to TLS endpoints.
