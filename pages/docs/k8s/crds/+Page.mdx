# Kubernetes Operator Custom Resources (CRDs)

Kubernetes has the concept of [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) (CRDs) which allow you to define your own custom resources.
This document will cover the CRDs you might use to achieve your goals with the ngrok Kubernetes Operator.
