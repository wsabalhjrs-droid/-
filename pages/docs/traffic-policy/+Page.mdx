# Traffic Policy

ngrok's Traffic Policy is a configuration language that offers you the flexibility to filter, match, manage and orchestrate traffic to your endpoints.

With ngrok's Traffic Policy you can:

- Validate incoming traffic
- Block malicious traffic
- Rewrite URLs
- Respond with custom content
- Forward traffic to your agents running across the globe
- And more

Because you can add traffic policies to any type of ngrok endpoint, you can use them to scope traffic management for each of your endpoints. For example, API teams can manage a traffic policy for their internal services while devops or security teams can manage policies for public services.
